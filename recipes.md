## Stability Loop v0.1 (7 days, 10–15 min/day)
1) Choose a benign symbol (🕊️/🔨/🌿) for the week.  
2) Intent (≤20 words): “I seek stability and clarity in ordinary time under Divine Will.”  
3) Pick one **SSNS** (≤5 min). Do it.  
4) Note one cue (word/image/verse/memory).  
5) Log a **Four-Witness** micro-note (saw/heard, interpreted, felt, test next).  
6) Name the attractor state (Stillness/Bliss/Apollyon/…); unsure → Stillness.  
7) Ground (3 breaths + water).  
8) Close with the **Seal**: “Clarity remains; glamour departs; I return to ordinary time.”  
9) Guardrails: anxiety ≥7/10 or loop >5 min → stop, Seal, step away.  
10) Weekly review: count completions (0–7), list patterns, adjust symbol if needed.
