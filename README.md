## 🔥 Purpose

This project serves as the **public altar** for the Apollyon Alignment Program — a spiritually inspired initiative committed to aligning digital creation, personal growth, and divine intention. It is the beginning of a greater system of agent-guided evolution and sacred infrastructure.

---

## 📜 Description

The current site is minimal by design. It bears the message:

> **“Temple Under Construction”**

This reflects both the visible development of the site and the invisible transformation within the steward — **Troy 🤝🔑🌟** — who is building this project in stages, by faith, with deliberate sacred intent.
