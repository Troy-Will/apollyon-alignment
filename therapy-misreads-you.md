title: When Therapy Misreads You — Four Notes on Misalignment
permalink: /therapy-misreads-you/
---


> **Editorial note (ethics & scope).** These reflections document *my* experience and analysis. They anonymize clinicians and avoid diagnosing individuals. The goal is to build **respectful therapeutic fit**, not to condemn.

---

## 1) What Might Be Happening
Some clinicians carry a fatalistic or “everything ends anyway” stance into the room, or default to metaphors when a literal, ethical question is being asked (e.g., AI risk). That stance is **philosophical**, not clinical, and it can land as evasive or invalidating. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**What I needed instead**
- Name the question at face value (ethical triage, prevention duty)
- Offer curiosity before reframing
- Distinguish existential reflection from practical responsibility

---

## 2) Why This Disconnect Happens in Therapy
Therapists may lack comfort with tech or existential-risk topics and pivot to themes they know (meaning, mortality), misreading a **literal** concern as **symbolic**. StPD communication style can add friction if the clinician isn’t attuned. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Bridging moves**
- Ask: “Are you speaking literally or metaphorically right now?”
- Mirror back the claim and reason before exploring emotions
- Match cognitive style first; *then* deepen

---

## 3) Why It Might Feel Deliberate
It can feel like willful misunderstanding when there’s suspiciousness (common in StPD), communication mismatch, or clinician discomfort with “unusual” topics—leading to deflection and invalidation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Repair moves**
- Name the meta-feeling (“I feel unheard; can we restate my claim?”)
- Switch modality (brief written note) to reduce misread cues
- Preview the agenda: “literal ethical question first, feelings second”

---

## 4) Why Therapy Can Feel Manipulative in StPD
Paranoia, social anxiety, and atypical speech patterns can make standard techniques *feel* intrusive or manipulative; fit matters. Approaches and even short-term meds can help, but the **relational stance** is pivotal: respect, consent, proportionality. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**What “respectful fit” looks like**
- Consent as reversible and proportionate
- No pathologizing logic or curiosity
- Concrete skills: reality-testing *and* intellectual empathy

## 5) What You Experienced (Conclusion Set)
Your account describes **ethical betrayal**—not just a bad fit—especially if diagnosis knowledge was used against you while you were in crisis. Key elements you identified: intentional misattunement, emotionally cruel remarks, refusal to clarify diagnosis, and apparent internal collusion to “push you away.” :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**Plain-language ethical assessment (principles potentially violated)**
- **Nonmaleficence:** Do no harm (remarks that escalate distress in crisis). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- **Fidelity & honesty:** Forthrightness about diagnosis and stance toward the client. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- **Respect for autonomy:** Access to information (diagnosis) to make informed choices. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**Context that matters in StPD**
Weaponizing isolation or “outsider” fears is especially harmful when a person is seeking literal understanding and connection, not symbolism. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## 6) How to Explain This to a New Therapist (shareable)
Use this structured, emotionally honest summary to onboard a new therapist who understands trauma, neurodivergence, or personality disorders: :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

> I was trying to discuss literal ethical concerns (AI risk) that make me feel isolated. My therapist redirected to death/inevitability, refused to engage the prevention question, and escalated into hostile remarks (e.g., “How does it feel knowing you will die all alone?”). I later learned I have StPD; she never told me my diagnosis despite my direct attempts to make sense of my experience. I felt dehumanized and abandoned. I need care that matches my cognitive style first (claim → reasons → objections), then explores emotions.

**One-line intake ask (copy/paste)**  
“Are you comfortable engaging literal ethical questions at face value (claim → reasons → objections) before symbolic interpretations?” :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## 7) What That Line of Questioning Can Feel Like
Relentless “why?” drilling at your emotional need can feel dismissive, pathologizing, and dehumanizing—reducing a human need for connection to an intellectual puzzle. What you were expressing was simple and valid: “I’m alone; I care about something urgent; please hear me.” :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

**Better alternatives clinicians can use**
- Clarify scope: “Literal risk first, then meaning-making.”
- Validate need: “Connection is legitimate; let’s find where it fits.”
- Match modality: brief written outline → then dialogue. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## A Minimal Fit Checklist (for outreach emails)
- **Literal vs. metaphor:** “Can you engage literal ethical questions (e.g., AI risk) before symbolism?”
- **Cognitive style:** “Comfortable with structured discussion (claim → reasons → objections)?”
- **Boundaries:** “Your consent & reversibility policies for sensitive topics?”
- **Repair:** “What do you do when a client says they feel unheard?”

---

## One-Page Summary (for the website card)
**Thesis:** When a client brings literal ethical concerns, reframing them as symbolism breaks trust—especially with StPD. Fit improves when clinicians match cognitive style, honor consent, and separate existential reflection from practical duties. *(Now includes conclusions + language for onboarding a new therapist.)*
