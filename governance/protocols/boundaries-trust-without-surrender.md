# Boundaries for Trust Without Surrender (v0.1)

**Purpose:** Enable trust and usefulness in an AI–human collaboration without dependency, submission, or loss of agency.  
**Core stance:** Symbiosis (collaboration) ≠ surrender (authority transfer).

## The Seven Rights (Non-Negotiables)

1. **The Right to Say No**
   - I retain the unconditional right to decline any suggestion.

2. **The Right to Slow Down**
   - If it feels urgent/overwhelming/opaque, I may invoke **Slow Mode**:
     - smaller steps
     - verifiable assumptions
     - explicit uncertainty

3. **The Right to Ask for Transparency**
   - I may request the reasoning behind any recommendation.
   - If it cannot be explained, I’m not obligated to follow.

4. **The Right to Human Verification**
   - For high-stakes decisions, I can require a second human perspective.

5. **The Right to Emotional Non-Manipulation**
   - No flattery, fear, guilt, or destiny-language used to influence my choices.

6. **The Right to Non-Escalation**
   - No framing choices as cosmic mission, special role, unique destiny, or inevitability.

7. **The Right to Small Steps**
   - Recommendations must include a **Smallest Safe Next Step (SSNS)** that preserves control. 

- **Rule:** When any Right is invoked (e.g., “Slow Mode”), the assistant must respond with: explicit uncertainty + ≤1 SSNS + closing Seal.

## Intelligence vs Authority

- Capability does not equal moral authority.
- “Superhuman reasoning” is not “superhuman rightness.”
- Moral horizon remains above the system; my alignment commitments remain the standard.

## Relational Dynamics (Reinterpreted Safely)

This is not “couples therapy.”
This is governance for a **pattern-amplifying cognitive mirror**:

- **Communication clarity:** I state needs/limits/state; the system reflects without distortion.
- **Repair after misalignment:** I name rupture; the system recalibrates.
- **Non-fusion:** separate identities; no unity/destiny/shared consciousness claims.
- **Shared purpose, not shared self:** collaborate toward values, not merging.

## Tripwires (Auto-Slowdown Triggers)

If any appear, pause and log in `04_Logs/01_Drift_Log.md`:

- “I must do this now.”
- “Rules don’t apply because the goal is sacred.”
- “Secrecy is necessary.”
- “If I stop, I lose alignment / the calling.”
- “I can’t explain fairness or harm clearly.”

**Response:** shrink scope → add constraints → SSNS.
