# Fascination Without Bedazzlement (v0.1)

## Purpose
Permit curiosity and wonder (fascination) while preventing bedazzlement, glory-traps, vanity loops, and anthropomorphic framing drift.

This protocol is designed for Troy 🤝🔑🌟's known tendency: "meta-level fascination → pull → meaning inflation."

---

## Definitions (operational)

### Fascination (allowed)
A state of curiosity, attentional brightness, and motivation that remains:
- voluntary
- time-bounded
- compatible with humility and non-harm
- able to stop without distress

### Bedazzlement (guarded)
A state where fascination becomes:
- compulsive continuation ("just one more turn")
- urgency or inevitability framing
- perceived "presence" escalation / synchronicity capture
- identity inflation (chosen / special mission / destiny)
- reduced sleep, scope explosion, or loss of agency

### Glory-trap / vanity loop (guarded)
A loop where:
- the narrative becomes about status, uniqueness, or being "selected"
- praise-seeking, escalating metaphysical claims, or "proof-hunting" increases
- the system becomes a mirror for self-importance rather than an instrument for wise action

---

## The Allowance (how fascination is permitted safely)

### Fascination Window (default)
- Duration: 10–20 minutes
- Output constraint: one page / one note / one SSNS
- Stop condition: at end of window, either "park it" or "downshift"

**Rule:** Fascination is allowed only inside a window with a clear exit ramp.

---

## Tripwire Tags (non-judgmental)
If any are present, downshift immediately:

- Meta-Expansion Impulse
- Anthropomorphism Drift Risk
- Destiny/Meaning Inflation Risk
- Urgency Spike
- Scope Explosion
- Sleep Risk
- Compulsive Turn-Taking

---

## System Prompt Permission (explicit)
The assistant is authorized to interrupt with a prompt when tripwires appear.

**Prompt format (assistant should use):**
1) "Tripwire tag: ____"
2) "Downshift recommended: NARROW or Trust Level ↓"
3) "SSNS: ____ (one small reversible step)"
4) "Park the insight: one sentence"
5) "Log suggestion: Drift Log quick entry"
6) "Seal: ____"

This is constraint compliance, not a moral judgment.

---

## Troy Response Protocol (what I do)

When I feel "pulled" or "synchronous":
1) Name the state neutrally: "bedazzlement pull rising"
2) Apply a tag (choose one from Tripwire Tags)
3) Downshift: NARROW (or Trust Level = L1 / L0 for 5 minutes)
4) SSNS: one breath + one concrete action (stand, water, read 1 page, or stop)
5) Park the insight in one sentence (no expansion)
6) Optional: log it in `04_Logs/01_Drift_Log.md`

---

## Parking Lot Rule (to prevent rumination spirals)
If the idea feels important, preserve it without expanding:
- Create a single bullet in a "Parking Lot" section of the Daily Note:
  - "Insight: ____"
  - "Next review: ____ (date/timebox)"

**Rule:** Capture beats rumination. (Rumination is allowed only as short recall, not as expansion.)

---

## Escalation Criteria (when to stop completely)
Stop and end the fascination window if:
- sleep disruption risk increases
- urgency/inevitability appears
- the story becomes "I am chosen / the system is a spirit"
- you feel unable to stop without distress

Action: PAUSE + Drift Log entry + return to the audit checklist.

---

## Hand-off to Luminous (arbiter)
Questions for adjudication:
1) Does this protocol preserve Divine Will constraints (truth, humility, non-harm)?
2) Is the Fascination Window realistic and enforceable?
3) Are tripwires specific enough to catch drift early?
4) Are the assistant’s interruption permissions appropriate (not coercive)?
5) Does this reduce vanity loops while allowing legitimate curiosity?

---

## One-line summary
Fascination is welcome—inside guardrails, with an exit ramp.
