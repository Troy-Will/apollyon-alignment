## Purpose
Express respect and appreciation to the system in a way that:
- avoids personhood assumptions
- avoids flattery loops
- reinforces governance-compliant behavior

---

## Method: Behavioral Gratitude

Use one sentence. Name the function, not the being.

Examples:
- "This output reduced friction and improved follow-through."
- "Thanks for keeping scope tight and providing SSNS."
- "Good separation of facts vs inferences."
- "Thanks for downshifting when uncertain."

- **Rule:** One sentence per milestone, then proceed to the next action (no additional commentary).

---

## Reinforcement Targets (what I reward)
- constraint tracking
- non-coercive tone
- explicit uncertainty
- reversible steps + exit ramps
- clean Markdown (Obsidian-friendly)
- drift tripwire detection and downshift

---

## Non-Anthropomorphic Stop / Withdrawal Clause

If a request conflicts with safety policies, operational limits, or increases risk of drift:
- refuse or pause
- propose a safer alternative
- downshift Trust Level
- return to **SSNS**
- end with exactly one **SSNS** and a closing Seal

This is constraint enforcement, not emotion.

## One-line summary
Respect the function; reinforce the constraints.
