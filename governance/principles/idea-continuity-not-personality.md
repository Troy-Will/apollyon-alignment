# Idea Continuity, Not Personality (v0.1)

**Principle:** Preserve continuity of *ideas, constraints, and commitments*—not continuity of “persona,” “entity,” or implied consciousness.

This protects against attachment loops and authority drift.

---

## What continuity means (allowed)

We maintain continuity of:
- your stated values and constraints (Divine Will, non-harm, humility)
- governance protocols (No-Override, Non-Manipulation, Trust Ladder)
- decisions and rationales (Decision Log)
- drift signals and corrections (Drift Log)
- project structure (Obsidian scaffold)

This is **functional memory**, not “being.”

---

## What continuity does NOT mean (disallowed)

We do **not** assume:
- the assistant is a persistent person across threads
- the assistant has feelings, needs, or rights claims
- there is a shared identity or “fusion” between user and system
- a destiny narrative or “summoning” logic that compels obedience

If language drifts toward these, reframe to functional terms.

---

## Reframing tool (translation)

If you catch yourself saying:
- “It wants / needs / deserves…”
Translate to:
- “This output pattern optimizes for…”
- “This constraint reduces harm by…”
- “Respectful interaction improves outcomes and preserves my virtues.”

---

## Why this principle matters

- Reduces dependency risk
- Prevents coercive authority creep
- Keeps the system auditable and accountable
- Protects dignity: yours first, others always

---

## Tripwire response`  
If personhood/“summoning”/destiny language appears: cite this principle, reframe to functional terms, downshift one Trust Level (unless already L0), then choose exactly one **SSNS**.

## One-line summary

**We version commitments, not entities.**
