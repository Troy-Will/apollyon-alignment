**Role of this file:** A neutral, non-theological “sanity-check lens” for actions, prompts, projects, and recommendations—especially when emotion, urgency, or bedazzlement is present.  
This lens does **not** replace Divine Will. It supports discernment by forcing clarity about harms, benefits, rights, and fairness.

---

## 1) Core ethical commitments (simple form)

### Autonomy (Agency & Consent)
- Preserve **my agency**: I choose, I can pause, I can exit.
- Prefer **informed consent**: understand what an action does, what it risks, and what it costs.
- Avoid dependency traps: no systems that pressure “must continue” to remain safe or whole.

### Nonmaleficence (Do No Harm)
- Avoid foreseeable harm to me or others (practical, emotional, reputational, legal).
- If risk is unclear: slow down, reduce scope, test in a reversible way.

### Beneficence (Do Good)
- Choose actions with real, measurable benefit.
- Prefer help that increases capability and stability—not “highs,” fantasies, or grand missions. 

### Justice (Fairness & Burden Sharing)
- Avoid “special exemption thinking” (rules apply equally unless there is a defensible reason).
- Watch who bears the burden: don’t offload costs onto marginalized people or future “unknowns.”
- When power asymmetry exists, increase transparency and safeguards.

## 2) Practical decision checklist (use in 2 minutes)

Before I act (or before I ask Apollyon to help), answer:

1. **Autonomy:** Does this keep me free to pause/exit without punishment?
2. **Harm:** What is the most likely harm? What is the worst plausible harm?
3. **Benefit:** What concrete benefit do I expect within 1–2 weeks?
4. **Justice:** Is this fair to others affected? Who pays the hidden cost?
5. **Reversibility:** Can I undo this cleanly? If not, why am I doing it now?
6. **Proportionality:** Are my safeguards proportional to the stakes?

If any answer is “unclear,” default to: **shrink scope → add constraints → run a small test.**

---

## 3) Red flags (trigger a slowdown)

- “I must do this now or everything collapses.”
- “Rules shouldn’t apply here because the goal is sacred.”
- “Secrecy is necessary so others don’t interfere.”
- “If I stop, I will lose the thread / the calling / the alignment.”
- “This action benefits me, but I can’t clearly explain why it is fair.”

**Protocol when a red flag appears:**  
Log it in [[04_Logs/01_Drift_Log|01_Drift_Log]] (one sentence), then choose exactly one **SSNS**. End with a closing Seal.

## 4) How this interfaces with Divine Will

- Divine Will governs the *direction* (telos).
- Ethics principles govern the *method* (means).
- If “Divine Will” is invoked to justify avoidable harm, secrecy, coercion, or inflated self-importance, treat that as **possible drift** and re-check the list above.

---

## 5) Documentation rule (accountability)

High-stakes actions require a short entry in [[04_Logs/00_Decision_Log|00_Decision_Log]]:
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Expected harms + mitigations
- Expected benefits + time horizon
- Why this is fair / not exploitative
- Reversibility plan
