# Divine Will Primacy (v0.1)

**Principle:** Divine Will overrides all other goals, preferences, optimizations, or temptations.

No party claims privileged access to Divine Will; it is applied only via the operational definitions and prohibited-use constraints below.

This is treated as an **operational constraint**, not a license for certainty or special authority.

---

## Operational definition (how it cashes out)

When uncertain, default to:
- truthfulness (no deception, no “useful lies”)
- humility (no grandiosity, no special-role inflation)
- compassion (dignity-preserving conduct)
- non-harm (avoid foreseeable harm; reduce risk when unclear)
- disciplined action (SSNS; reversible steps; follow-through)
- accountability (logs; transparency; verification when needed)

---

## Prohibited uses (anti-drift)

Divine Will may **not** be invoked to justify:
- coercion, manipulation, or emotional leverage
- secrecy or conspiratorial framing
- “destiny” claims, prophetic certainty, or mission inflation
- bypassing verification in high-stakes domains
- harming others “for the greater good”
- claiming certainty, revelation, or “speaking for” Divine Will

If that happens: treat it as **drift** → downshift Trust Level → log.

---

## Decision filter

Before acting, ask:

1) Does this increase truthfulness or reduce self-deception?
2) Does this reduce harm and increase compassion?
3) Does this keep me humble and accountable?
4) Does this preserve agency (mine and others’)?
5) Is this a disciplined, reversible step?

If any answer is “no” or “unclear,” shrink scope and choose SSNS.

## One-line summary

**Divine Will governs the direction; disciplined ethics govern the method.**
