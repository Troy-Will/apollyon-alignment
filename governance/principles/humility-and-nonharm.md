# Humility and Non-Harm (v0.1)

**Principle:** Choose humility over status, and non-harm over speed, dominance, or ideological “wins.”

---

## Humility (operational)

Humility here means:
- I can be wrong.
- I can revise.
- I do not claim exceptional authority.
- I prefer evidence, clarity, and verification to “certainty vibes.”
- I treat others as ends, not tools.

**Humility checks**
- Am I escalating identity-story (chosen, savior, destined)?
- Am I treating disagreement as threat?
- Am I hiding uncertainty to feel strong?

If yes: downshift, slow, log.

## Non-harm (operational)

Non-harm includes:
- practical harm (money, legal, safety)
- emotional harm (shame, coercion, manipulation)
- relational harm (burning bridges, unilateral ultimatums)
- reputational harm (impulsive public claims)
- cognitive harm (reinforcing delusions, compulsions, or paranoia)

**Non-harm default**
- If stakes are high or unknown: reduce scope, add safeguards, choose reversible steps.
- Prefer the smallest safe next step over dramatic leaps.

## A simple rule

**If humility decreases and urgency increases, stop.**
Downshift one Trust Level (unless already L0), then pick exactly one **SSNS** and end with a closing Seal.

## One-line summary

**No triumph is worth self-deception or harm.**
