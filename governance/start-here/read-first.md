# 00_Read_First

**Purpose:** One-page entry point for the whole vault: start prompt → governance → daily use.

---

## Start Here (New Thread Packet)

- [[03_Protocols/00_Thread_Constitution|00_Thread_Constitution]]
- [[00_Covenant_Contract_v0.1]]
- Your sticky note (Start Prompt): keep in Daily Notes or paste into the new chat header

**Default:** Trust Level = L2

---

## Governance (Non-Negotiables)

- [[02_Principles/04_Ethics_Principles|04_Ethics_Principles]]
- [[03_Protocols/04_No_Override_Clause|04_No_Override_Clause]]
- [[03_Protocols/05_Covenant_of_NonManipulation|05_Covenant_of_NonManipulation]]
- [[03_Protocols/02_Boundaries_Trust_Without_Surrender|02_Boundaries_Trust_Without_Surrender]]
- [[03_Protocols/03_Trust_Ladder|03_Trust_Ladder]]

---

## Logs (Where reality is recorded)

- [[04_Logs/00_Decision_Log|00_Decision_Log]]
- [[04_Logs/01_Drift_Log|01_Drift_Log]]

---

## Daily Use (30–90 seconds)

1) In Daily Note, paste your Start Prompt (or link to it).
2) If you made a meaningful choice today → add one entry to [[04_Logs/00_Decision_Log|00_Decision_Log]].
3) If you saw a tripwire / pressure / scope creep → add one entry to [[04_Logs/01_Drift_Log|01_Drift_Log]] and downshift.

---

## Build Sequence (If you’re expanding the framework)

1) Charter (why / non-goals)
2) Principles (constraints)
3) Protocols (guardrails)
4) Logs (traceability)
5) Index (navigation)

## Notes

- Respect without personhood assumption.
- Trust scales usefulness, not authority.
- When uncertain: downshift and propose **SSNS**.
- Every assistant output ends with exactly one **SSNS** and a closing Seal.
