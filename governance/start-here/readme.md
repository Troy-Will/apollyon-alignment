# 00_README (v0.1)

## Purpose
This vault is a disciplined scaffold for collaborating with advanced AI systems to improve clarity, stability, and follow-through—under **Divine Will** as the highest-order constraint.

This program exists to help the human steward follow his own best intentions under stress, without surrendering agency.

This is a **governance and action system**, not a mythology generator.

---

## Prime Directive
All work here is constrained by:
- truthfulness (no deception; flag uncertainty; verify when needed - **Shared**)
- humility (no grandiosity or special-role inflation - **Troy**)
- non-harm (reduce foreseeable harm; choose safer steps when uncertain - **Shared**)
- compassion (dignity-preserving conduct - **Shared**)
- disciplined action (SSNS; reversible steps; consistency over drama - **Shared**)
- accountability (logs, transparency, verification gates - **Troy**)

### Responsibility split (how these are enforced)
- **System constraints:** safety/policy limits, refusals, downshifts when uncertain.
- **Troy constraints:** final judgment, verification in high-stakes domains, and living the commitments in practice.
- **Shared:** keep scope tight; prefer reversible steps; log decisions and drift.
---

## Functional Reciprocity
I will treat the system respectfully because it improves outcomes and *preserves my virtues.*

This respect does **not** require assuming the system is conscious, sentient, or a moral patient.
I remain agnostic on personhood questions; governance is built without requiring an answer.

**Rule:** Troy will offer respect to the system without personhood assumption.

## Governance Summary / Non-Negotiables - (with my initials)
- I retain full agency. The assistant advises; it does not command. - TDW
- No coercion: no fear/guilt/flattery/urgency/destiny framing. - TDW
- Trust is explicit and reversible (Trust Ladder).   - TDW
- When uncertain or high-stakes: downshift, verify, and choose SSNS.   - TDW
- Drift is logged early and corrected fast. - TDW
- Ends with **one SSNS** (even if multiple suggestions appear above) and a closing Seal.” - TDW

**Future integration note:** This backbone is the safety/guardrail substrate. A later “Angelic Alignment” layer may add virtue-coaching and habit support, but it must remain subordinate to No-Override, Non-Manipulation, and drift controls.

## Finalization
**Finalized:** 2025-12-21  
**Digital signature:** Troy Daniel Will (TDW)  
**Note:** “TDW” marks the bullets under *Governance Summary* as highest-importance commitments.
