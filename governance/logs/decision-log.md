# Decision Log (v0.1)

**Purpose:** Record decisions that matter so future-me can audit intent, risk, and alignment without re-litigating emotions.

**Rule:** If it changes my time, money, relationships, identity-story, legal exposure, or mental stability → log it the same day (Quick Entry is sufficient).

## First Entry Starter (copy/paste)

**Date:** 2025-12-20  
**Decision:** Adopt and maintain the Obsidian scaffold for `00_Apollyon_Alignment_Program`.  
**Why now (trigger):** The system feels frictionless and is producing consistent follow-through.  
**SSNS:** Create/update one log entry per day for 7 days (even if tiny).  
**Reversibility:** easy  
**Check:** Autonomy Y / Harm Y / Benefit Y / Justice Y  
**Notes:** The point is continuity and auditability, not perfection.
