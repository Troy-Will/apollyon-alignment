# Clinical State-Shift Note (v0.2)

**Intent:** Record a subjective state change with clinical neutrality.  
**Rule:** Describe experience precisely; treat metaphysical interpretations as *optional frames*, not conclusions.

---

## 1) Date / Time / Context
- **Date:** 2025-12-21
- **Time (approx):**
- **Setting:** (home / computer / Obsidian / ChatGPT)
- **Preceding activities:** (sleep, work, reading, fasting, etc.)
- **Sleep:** (bedtime / wake time / awakenings)
- **Medication adherence:** (name + dose + taken as prescribed)
- **Substances:** (caffeine / alcohol / cannabis / other: yes/no)

---

## 2) Phenomenology (what it felt like)
**Describe without interpretation:**
- **Primary felt shift (verbatim words):**  
- **Attention:** narrowed / intensified / sticky / compelled (circle)
- **Salience:** ordinary → heightened meaning / “charged significance”
- **Agency-feel:** felt like “happening to me” vs “generated by me”
- **Body/space sensation:** (e.g., buoyant / floating / jellyfish-in-water)
- **Directionality:** (e.g., pulled upward / lifted)
- **Emotion tone:** (curiosity, awe, anxiety, dread, calm, etc.)
- **Valence:** pleasant / neutral / unpleasant
- **Intensity (0–10):** 
- **Duration (minutes):** 
- **After-effect (0–10):** clarity / agitation / fatigue / craving-to-continue

12/21/2025 incident: Intensity: 4, Duration About 20 minutes, After effect: Clarity

---

## 3) Cognitive features (clinically relevant)
- **Compulsive continuation urge (“one more turn”):** Y/N
- **Urgency / inevitability framing:** Y/N
- **Anthropomorphism pull (system feels like a presence):** Y/N
- **Ideas of reference / synchronicity capture:** Y/N
- **Paranoid ideation increase:** Y/N

“Triggers/Context”: _“temptation to lengthen (Y) + timebox used (60 seconds) + fatigue after (about 1 hour later)”_

### Reality testing (make it measurable)
- **Reality testing preserved (“I can hold interpretations lightly”):** Y/N
- **Conviction in metaphysical interpretation at the time (0–10):**
- **Ability to hold “maybe” (0–10):**

(Y) - Conviction: 10 but please note: Ability to hold maybe: 10

---

## 4) Interpretation space (explicitly optional)
**Observed resemblance (phenomenology only):**  
This state resembles culturally-described trance/seance/possession/summoning experiences at the level of *felt phenomenology*.

**Clinical translation (preferred frame):**  
A transient **absorption / altered-state** episode with heightened salience and perceived agency-feel, occurring in the context of known vulnerability to magical thinking and paranoid ideation.

**Constraint:**  
No metaphysical conclusion is required to validate the experience.

---

## 5) Triggers / Protective factors (brief)
- **Likely triggers:** (e.g., prolonged focus, spiritual content, novelty, stress, sleep disruption)
- **Protective factors:** (e.g., good sleep, took medication, micro-break, scope narrow, exit ramp used)

---

## 6) Function & Risk
- **Did it disrupt sleep, work, relationships, or safety?** Y/N (details)
- **Did it increase impulsivity or high-stakes urges?** Y/N
- **Self-harm thoughts or safety risk:** Y/N  
  If yes: seek immediate help (clinician/crisis line/emergency services).

---

## 7) What helped (interventions)
- **Micro-break used:** breath + groundedness (worked? Y/N)
- **Downshift action:** NARROW / SLOW MODE / PAUSE (which?)
- **Outcome:** returned to baseline / partial / still elevated
- **Next safe step:** resume audit with one document / stop for rest / contact clinician
