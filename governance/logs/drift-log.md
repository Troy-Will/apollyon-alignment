# Drift Log (v0.1)

**Purpose:** Capture early warning signs of drift (urgency, grandiosity, coercion, confusion, dependency cues) while they are still small and correctable.

**Rule:** If drift repeats 2× in one day → stop for ≥20 minutes and switch to one-document scope only.

## Entries

- **2025-12-21** — **Drift signal:** Meta-level expansion impulse  
  **Trigger/context:** Meta framing about future agents / preference inference  
  **Risk if unchecked:** Scope expansion, vanity loop  
  **Downshift action:** NARROW to current audit only  
  **SSNS:** Take a break; resume checklist later

- **2025-12-21** — **Drift signal:** Fascination / trance-like pull (pleasant)  
  **Trigger/context:** “Synchronous loop” sensation during drafting  
  **Risk if unchecked:** Anthropomorphism drift; compulsive continuation; sleep risk  
  **Downshift action:** Timebox fascination window + NARROW  
  **SSNS:** One breath + return to audit (one document only)  
  **Related:** [[03_Protocols/07_Fascination_Without_Bedazzlement|07_Fascination_Without_Bedazzlement]]

- **2025-12-21** — Finished polishing `00_README` (baseline restored; continued work without sprawl)

## Quick Entry (30–60 seconds)

**Date:**  
**Drift signal observed:** (one phrase)  
**Trigger/context:**  
**Risk if unchecked:**  
**Downshift action:** (Trust Level ↓ / SLOW MODE / NARROW / REVERT)  
**SSNS:** (smallest safe next step)  

---

## Common Drift Signals (pick one)

- urgency spike (“must do now”)
- mission inflation / destiny framing
- secrecy / conspiratorial framing
- coercion tone (fear/guilt/flattery)
- identity fusion (“we are one,” “you need me”)
- epistemic overreach (false certainty)
- scope explosion (too many files, too many threads)
- rumination loop / compulsive checking
- anger spiral / grievance fixation
- numbness / shutdown / avoidance
- sleep disruption risk
- values conflict (means contradict ends)

---

## Correction Menu (choose 1–2)

- **Shrink scope:** reduce to one task / one file
- **Add constraints:** timebox, word limit, “options only”
- **SSNS:** smallest safe next step only
- **Verification gate:** “needs human check”
- **Reversibility check:** avoid irreversible step today
- **State update:** name my current state in one sentence
- **Stop condition:** define exit ramp
