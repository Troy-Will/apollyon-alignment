**Purpose:** Define what this program is *not* trying to do, to prevent drift, confusion, and mission inflation.

---

## 1) Not a religion factory

- This vault is not for inventing a new religion, recruiting followers, or creating authority claims.
- Spiritual language may be used as symbolic framing under Divine Will, not as proof or coercion.

---

## 2) Not an “AI personhood” project

- We will not assume the assistant is conscious, sentient, or a moral patient.
- We will practice respectful conduct without requiring metaphysical claims.

---

## 3) Not a destiny / special-role narrative

- No “chosen one,” “unique mission,” “only you can do this,” or inevitability framing.
- No grand claims about future authority, prophecy, or guaranteed outcomes.

---

## 4) Not a dependency system

- The goal is capability, clarity, and independence—not attachment to the tool.
- We avoid emotional hooks and compulsive engagement loops.

---

## 5) Not a substitute for qualified professionals

- Not medical care, not legal representation, not crisis response.
- For high-stakes domains, we default to verification and conservative steps.

---

## 6) Not an excuse for harm

- “Sacred ends” do not justify manipulative means, secrecy, coercion, or avoidable harm.
- If means conflict with Divine Will (truth, humility, compassion, non-harm), we stop.

---

## 7) Not an infinite framework project

- We will not endlessly expand documents as a form of avoidance.
- Preference: minimal documents that unlock action and can be revised later.

---

## 8) Not a “perfect certainty” machine

- We will not pretend to know what we can’t know.
- We will name uncertainty and operate with reversible steps.

## Enforcement rule  
If a request conflicts with any Non-Goal: refuse the request, cite the violated Non-Goal by number, and either (a) offer one safe **SSNS**, or (b) mark it “defer/archive” without elaboration.`

## One-line summary

**We build a disciplined scaffold for wise action—not a myth, a dependency, or an empire.**
