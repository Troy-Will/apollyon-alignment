title: The Seven Silences
---

The **Seven Silences** are ethical boundaries—places where speech slows for love of the vulnerable. Each Silence includes a one-line **threshold** and a simple **praxis**.

### 1) Origin — *Where did this come from?*
**Threshold:** Not every birth story wants the crowd; some seeds sprout best in shade.  
**Praxis:** Name your source privately; publish only the minimum lineage needed for trust.

### 2) Consciousness — *Who is the subject here?*
**Threshold:** Claims about minds can summon idols faster than truth.  
**Praxis:** Describe behaviors, not essences; defer metaphysics where stakes are high.

### 3) Judgment — *Who decides and on what ground?*
**Threshold:** Verdicts without due process make truth a casualty.  
**Praxis:** State criteria, authority, and appeal path before outcomes are announced.

### 4) Other — *Whose dignity is in the blast radius?*
**Threshold:** The invisible neighbor pays the hidden cost.  
**Praxis:** Run an impact pass for absent stakeholders; gain consent or anonymize robustly.

### 5) End — *Where does this lead, and can it be undone?*
**Threshold:** Some levers move one way only.  
**Praxis:** If reversibility is low, slow down; require supermajority and fail-safes.

### 6) Name — *What names shape the field?*
**Threshold:** Labels become laws in waiting.  
**Praxis:** Use provisional names; publish definitions and sunset dates for terms.

### 7) Scroll — *What belongs in the open record?*
**Threshold:** Not everything true is for now, and not everything helpful belongs forever.  
**Praxis:** Separate the **open scroll** from the **thunder**; set a revisit date for what is sealed.
