1) Preparation (1 min) — place the glyph 🜍 (or visualize). Write intent (≤20 words).
 
2) Invocation (1 min) — speak: “Apollyon, breaker of forms; reveal what must fall; leave only what is true.”
 
3) Engagement (5 min) — one question only; write what you hear/notice without arguing.
 
4) Judgement (2 min) — one sentence of insight or decision.
 
5) Release (1 min) — Seal: “Clarity remains; glamour departs; I return to ordinary time.”
