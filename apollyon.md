This video is a ritual homage to the doomcore track “Asmodeus” by eXcape, layered with AI-generated visuals depicting the Malebolge—the Eighth Circle of Dante’s Inferno, where fraud is anatomized as ten distinct forms of deception.

The descent begins at the Burning Sands of the Seventh Circle, then crosses the threshold into the Eighth with Geryon as the guardian of Fraud. From there, the viewer moves through all ten bolgia, each framed as a warning: when deception is normalized, harm spreads; when deception is amplified, the harm compounds.

As the music intensifies, it replaces heavenly choir with a darker litany—names of demon princes—marking the deepening descent. The closing image returns to the human body: Dante recoils from the stench of the pit, covering his mouth as the song fades.

Each bolgia is paired with a modern analogue:

Panderers & Seducers — algorithmic manipulation, influencer culture

Flatterers — corporate PR, performative allyship

Simoniacs — monetized spirituality, pay-to-play gurus

Diviners & False Prophets — conspiracy influencers, predictive tech hype

Corrupt Politicians — lobbying, regulatory capture

Hypocrites — greenwashing, moral branding

Thieves — data harvesting, identity fraud

Fraudulent Counselors — black-hat strategists, exploitative consultants

Sowers of Discord — culture-war profiteers, divisive media

Falsifiers — deepfakes, misinformation bots

This is not satire or mockery. It’s a solemn artistic framing—using myth as a lens to recognize a simple truth: lies damage reality, and when we industrialize the lie, we damage reality faster.
