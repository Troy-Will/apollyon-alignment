**Key context to review:** [When Therapy Misreads You](/therapy-misreads-you/)


**Purpose.** This site is a *prototype* for a calm, safe, symbolic practice. It offers short “recipes” with firm guardrails to help users build stable attention and meaning-making **in ordinary time**.

**What I’m testing**
- Brief, time-limited exercises (≤10–15 min; ≤2/day).
- Plain-language logging (Saw/Heard · Interpreted · Felt · Test next).
- “Seals” and **Warnings** to prevent dissociative drift.

**Clinical guardrails**
- Stop if anxiety ≥ **7/10**; close with the Seal, water, and a short walk.
- No altered states; well-lit room; hydrated; grounded.
- Reversibility: if something sticks, write it down, do a neutral task, revisit tomorrow.
- This is *not* treatment; users follow their clinician’s guidance.

**How it may help**
- Gentle structure for journaling + metacognitive labeling.
- Safer container for exploring symbols without metaphysical claims.
- Simple habits that can complement therapy homework.

**Notes**
- All practices remain optional; discontinue if they interfere with care.
- Feedback on language, safety, or scope is welcome at this prototype stage.
