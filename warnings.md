**Use gently.** If anxiety ≥ **7/10**, **stop** and **Seal** (“Clarity remains… I return to ordinary time.”) + water + 30 steps.

- **Time limits:** ≤ 10–15 min per session; ≤ 2 sessions/day.
- **No altered states:** ordinary time only (well-lit room, hydrated, grounded).
- **Reversibility:** if something sticks, write it down, do a neutral task, revisit tomorrow.
- **Social check:** share concerns with a trusted person; pause if feedback says “you’re spiraling.”
- **Medical/therapy:** this isn’t treatment; if you’re in care, follow your clinician’s guidance.

**If drift begins:** name it → breathe ×3 → drink water → walk 30 steps → close with the Seal.
